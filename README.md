## Compatibility

This add-on is compatible with OpenNebula 3.8, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4.
Tested extensively with 4.4 (EC2)

## INSTALLATION

### REQUISITES

OpenNebula Server installation is required.

### INSTALLATION

The installation script assumes OpenNebula is installed system-wide.
To install, run the following script:

    $ ./install.sh

An init script is provided for Debian based distributions.

### REDIRECT TO 169.254.169.254:80

To comply with EC2, the metadata server should be available from 
http://169.254.169.254:80.
To enable this either:

- Setup a redirect rule on the default gateway
- Setup a redirect on each host, using iptables

#### REDIRECT ON DEFAULT GATEWAY

This is out of scope for this document

#### REDIRECT USING IPTABLES

The rp_filter must be disabled for each cloud interface/bridge.
To do so, add a line to /etc/sysctl.conf for each interface:
```
net.ipv4.conf.<interface_name>.rp_filter = 0
```
If using bridges, the following line must also be added/modified:
```
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
```
On each host, run the following at startup (ex.: using rc.local):
```
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 169.254.169.254/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination <metadata_server_ip>:<metadata_server_port>
```

### CONTEXT

The metadata server was thought to work with instances launched by eucatools, hybridfox or econe-* , and assumes that you are using the standard /etc/one/ec2query_templates/*.erb .
If a custom template is to be used, add the folowing context variables:
```
CONTEXT         = [
  (...)
    EC2_USER_DATA = <YOUR USER DATA>
    EC2_PUBLIC_KEY = <YOUR PUBLIC KEY>
    EC2_KEYNAME = <THE NAME OF THE KEY>
  ]
```
If there is the need to use other variables instead, just change them on /usr/lib/one/ruby/cloud/metadata/MetadataServer.rb.
Search and replace with your own data:
```
  TEMPLATE/CONTEXT/EC2_KEYNAME
  TEMPLATE/CONTEXT/EC2_PUBLIC_KEY
  TEMPLATE/CONTEXT/EC2_USER_DATA
```

### TEST

To test the metadata server, download and run the EC2 Instance Metadata Query Tool tool from inside an instance.
The EC2 Instance Metadata Query Tool tool is available 

    http://aws.amazon.com/code/1825
